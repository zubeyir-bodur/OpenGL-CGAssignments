# Computer Graphics Assignments in OpenGL

This repository is a showcase of my computer graphics assignments which were developed using:
- OpenGL
- GLFW 3.3.8, for creating windows and retrieving input
- GLEW 2.1.0, for accessing modern OpenGL API
- ImGui, for drawing basic GUI components.

To be determined.
